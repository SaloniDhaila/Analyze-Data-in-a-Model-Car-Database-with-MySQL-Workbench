# Analyze Data in a Model Car Database with MySQL Workbench

**Project Description**

This project, hosted on Coursera for the fictitious Mint Classics Company. The objective is to restructure or minimize the company's inventory while ensuring that they continue to provide timely service to their customers.

**Business Task**

The main task was to analyze data within a relational database, focusing on aiding inventory-related business decisions aimed at eventually shutting down a storage facility.

**Tools Used**
<ul>
  <li>MySQL Workbrench</li>
  <li>MS Excel</li>
</ul>


## Cleaning and Transforming Data

In the process of cleaning and transforming data, I completed the following task-

**Task 1**:  Imported the MintClassics data, which was supplied as part of the Coursera project.

**Task 2**: Understood the mint classics data and its business processes with the help of [EER (Extended Entity-Relationship)](https://github.com/SaloniDhaila/Analyze-Data-in-a-Model-Car-Database-with-MySQL-Workbench/blob/main/MintClassicsDataModel.png) diagram provided in the project.

**Task 3**: Analyzed the business issue and determine the tables that will be influenced.

**Task 4**: Crafted proposals and advice for resolving the business issue.

**Task 5**: Outlined the recommendations and conclusions, substantiated with the assistance of SQL scripts.


## Data Analysis

After conducting a thorough data analysis, I formulated the following recommendations-

<ul>
  <li>Based on our inventory analysis, it has been identified that Warehouse D maintains the lowest inventory levels, making it a prime candidate for elimination.Furthermore, we propose that Warehouse D's inventory can be efficiently relocated to Warehouse C, as Warehouse C currently holds the second lowest inventory.</li><br/>  
  
<li>After examining the product orders, it is advisable to consider the elimination of less frequently ordered or inactive products, taking into account their historical sales data. </li><br/>  

<li>Modifying the prices of specific products with low sales can potentially facilitate the clearance of inventory.</li><br/>  

<li>Customers who exhibit both a high purchase amount and a substantial credit limit should be given priority and incentivized to encourage increased purchases.</li>
</ul>


The proposed solution or recommendations will enable the company to consider warehouse elimination by examining its inventory, less ordered or inactive products, pricing, and loyal customers.




These recommendations are founded on the analysis conducted with the support of SQL scripts, which are available for review here - [MintClassics.sql](https://github.com/SaloniDhaila/Analyze-Data-in-a-Model-Car-Database-with-MySQL-Workbench/blob/main/MintClassics.sql)
